## About The Project
### Description
<p> 
 In the past, we looked at APIs that ultimately access a repository of data stored in a database. We looked at the most common form of database structure, Structured QWuery Language (SQL).
 For the project, I created my first persistent data system by developing a management portal for a medical practitioner's office.
