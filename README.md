## About The Project
### Description
<p> 
 In the past, we looked at APIs that ultimately access a repository of data stored in a database. We looked at the most common form of database structure, Structured QWuery Language (SQL).
 For the project, I created my first persistent data system by developing a management portal for a medical practitioner's office.
</p>
<p>
 This project was built with Visual Studio Code with the help of XAMPP for managing my database.
</p>

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
<p>
 In order to have access to the database one requires XAMPP to be installed on your device.
</p>
<p>
 To download XAMPP you can simply click the link <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/">here</a>
</p>

## Features And Functionality
<p> On the index page you won't be able to go to a different page without logging in first. in order to see the other pages you will need to log in with the correct information otherwise you will be given an error that tells you what information field is wrong or missing. When the detail of the user is correct they will be redirected to the home page where the appointments are shown. in the navigation bar, the name of the receptionist that is logged in will be displayed and shown on all pages' navigation bar.</p>

<p> On all the pages you will be able you update/ delete/ create and read the data from my database. On the appointment/home page, the information that can be updated or created uses a select option element that sends the value to the database and not the names selected.</p>

<p>On the other two pages (patients and doctors) the receptionist can update the images of the users and that image is saved in the database and in your local files.</p>

<p>When a receptionist is done she/he can click on the Logout button and will be redirected to the login page and will need to sign in again to view the other pages or to make changes.</p>

## Concept Process
<h3>Ideation</h3>
<p>For my inspiration I looked at Mediclinic and the way they display information about doctors and how they are displayed. Click <a href="https://www.mediclinic.co.za/en/corporate/find-a-doctor.html">here</a> to view.</p>
